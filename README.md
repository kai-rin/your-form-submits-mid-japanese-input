# Your Form Submits Mid-Japanese Input

This repository contains a static site that explains a common problem with web forms for Japanese users. When a Japanese user hits the Enter key to confirm their input, the form may unintentionally submit, causing frustration and interrupting the user's text entry.

## Why this matters

This problem can make it virtually impossible for Japanese users to type more than one sentence in a web form without being interrupted by unintended form submissions. It's a significant usability issue that can give the impression that the website or service doesn't care about its Japanese users' experience.

- A clear explanation of the problem and why it occurs
- Examples of how this issue affects Japanese users
